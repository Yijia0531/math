Find the time between 4 and 5 o'clock when the two hands of a clock form an angle of 180 degrees?

Also, he says that because the minute hand has gone past the hour hand to get to the straight line, the 180 degree angle answer has a small conundrum to work out before we can solve the linear equation.

How to find raw score when you know the mean and standard deviation?I've been trying to figure this out for three hours:
A psychology studied self-esteem scores and found the data set to be normally distributed with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 5.
I know how to find z-scores, but obviously I can't find it in this case because I don't know X. I assume I have to use the 33% to find X but I have no idea how to go about this.I'm not trying to cheat; please don't give me the answer. I would just really appreciate if someone could tell me the steps I need to use to figure this out. I'm ripping my hair out here.

An event happens that has 480 participants, and 8 of those are "chosen" (equal odds of being chosen).
Then a year later another event happens and there are 620 participants, of which 6 are chosen (again equal odds on being chosen).  Of the 620 the second year, about 180 of them were at the event the first year (I don't think the "year later" is a factor, but it's what happened... but how many people were at both might be a factor in the odds- I don't really know).
What is the chance of someone that attends both events to be one of the 8 AND THEN one of the 6 a year later??????

How do you determine the probability of an event happening at least once in a given set of trials?
My husband has an illness and according to statistics, there is a 13% chance that our daughter will have that illness.  I am expecting another child.  I know that the chance that both will have it is 13% x 13% or 1.69% (correct me if I'm wrong) and that if we have a third child the chance that all will have it is 13% X 13% X 13% or .2197%.  What I would like to know is that if we have two children, what is the chance that ONE will have the illness.  I know you don't simply add the probabilities and get 26%.  (Otherwise if I flipped a coin twice, the chance that I would get heads once would be 100% which it is clearly not).
So what is the formula I use?  And what is the probability of having one child with the condition if we have three children (or of two children out of three having it) and so on.
Thanks in advance!
