My teacher says that we need to know how quickly the minute hand and the hour hand move (as in degrees per minute). Also, he says that because the minute hand has gone past the hour hand to get to the straight line, the 180 degree angle answer has a small conundrum to work out before we can solve the linear equation."

Unfortunately, his car is in the shop so he must make other travel arrangements to reach his destination.  One option is to take a train that departs at 8:00 A.M.  Alternatively, he could ride to the meeting with another sales rep.\r\n\r\nBob has an important presentation to deliver at the meeting and needs to arrive as early as possible.   He knows that the train travels at 80 miles per hour, but has a 30 – minute layover halfway through the 156-mile trip.  He also knows that his friend cannot depart before 8:00 A.M. and will adamantly refuse to drive any faster than 55 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nIf both methods of transportation leave at the same time (8:00 A.M.), will the train or the car allow him to reach the regional sales meeting sooner?"
