Math Question?
The answer is 36 according to his math book.- which is correct of course. To get to the answer I simply divided 96 by 8 and multiplied it by 3 which gives me 36.BUT- in other sections of his math book it tells him to use the reciprocal method to find the answer for dividing a whole number by a fraction.  When should he simply divide the denominator into the whole number and then multiply it by the numerator versus using the reciprocal method (ie flip the fraction and multiply instead of divide by the whole number) to divide a whole number by a fraction?What is the difference and any suggestions for explaining this to a 5th grader
