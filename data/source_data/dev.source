Help me with this problem is my anwser right?
You have noticed that the unit of area in SI is m2 (squared, I dont know how to make the little 2 at the top like it's squared)

Can anyone clearly explain to me how to find a significant digit in a number?My math teacher is terrible :( I've asked him to explain this three times now, and each time he goes off on tangents about the important significant digits and never gets to any real coherent explanation how to find it. Now I've got a test tomorrow and I want to have a decent shot at getting this one right.
 Keeping only significant digits, express the following in decimal form: 6.5×0.667
Doing long multiplication (I'm not allowed to use a calculator), I can figure the answer to be 4.3355However, the significant digit answer would be 4.34 according to my teacher. The best I can assume is that he's rounding to the 2nd number after the decimal. but he never directly says that in his explanations. Yay or nay?
