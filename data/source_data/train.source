Calculating Permuations?Okay, I so don't remember how to do this. Help?I'm trying to figure out how many combinations I can pull. I'm starting with three data sets:
set 1 has 8 objects in it, set 2 also has 8 objects in it, data set 3 has 7 objects. I can pull an object from each set, but I can't pull more than one object from any given set at a time. (So only 1 each from set 1,2,3, but in any order, no repeats)
My first guess says I have 1,771 combinations, but I think I'm pulling more than one from each set. So I imagine I have fewer. Any one got a handy equation. This must be easier than I'm trying to make it. Thanks!

when I want the total amount minus 7% to equal $306.25? 
 And no, its not just a matter of adding $21.44 (7% of $306.25) to $306.25 - when you do that, and then you take 7% off the whole thing, the total amount of the invoice would be less than $306.25.  If you can show me the formula you used that would be great, because I'll have to do this often with several different amounts!

Find the time between 4 and 5 o'clock when the two hands of a clock form an angle of 180 degrees?
Intuitively, it has to be close to 4:55 but apparently we can use algebra to get the exact time. My teacher says that we need to know how quickly the minute hand and the hour hand move (as in degrees per minute). Also, he says that because the minute hand has gone past the hour hand to get to the straight line, the 180 degree angle answer has a small conundrum to work out before we can solve the linear equation.

Can anybody help me with finding the radius of a sphere!?"
I have a sphere that weighs 56.7 grams. Also, I know that the sphere has a density of 11.352 grams per cubic centimetre.
Is it possible for me to find the radius of the sphere.
I was thinking of perhaps trying to use the sphere volume formula which is:4/3 * pi * radius cubedPerhaps I could get the radius isolated but I'm kinda struggling. Is it possible to find the radius using only the mass and density? I know the answer is like 21.208 or something but I don't know how to get it. Please help! Any answers or help are appreciated. Thankyou!

The answer is 36 according to his math book.- which is correct of course. To get to the answer I simply divided 96 by 8 and multiplied it by 3 which gives me 36.BUT- in other sections of his math book it tells him to use the reciprocal method to find the answer for dividing a whole number by a fraction.  When should he simply divide the denominator into the whole number and then multiply it by the numerator versus using the reciprocal method (ie flip the fraction and multiply instead of divide by the whole number) to divide a whole number by a fraction?What is the difference and any suggestions for explaining this to a 5th grader

The Supreme ruler of Mars has decided to change the unit of length used in the United States from 12 inches per one foot to 10 inches per one foot because the supreme ruler.s foot is only 10 inches long.
Fortunately, the Martians are allowing the United States to keep the mile the exact same length so no new road signs and mile markers have to be created.
Now that the Martians have taken over our planet, how many feet are in one mile?

What is the formula for calculating the monthly payment for an Auto Loan?
The bank is financing my wife for 9606.00 at an interest rate of 7.5%.
The Term is for 5 yrs (60 months)
What should the monthly payments be?
I used to be able to do this, but I think I'm missing something.Here is how I did my math:I took $9606.00 and multiplied it times 7.5% and came up with $720.45. Then I added that $720.45 to the $9606.00 and came up with a total of $10,326.45. I then divided the $10,326.45 by 60 (months) and came up with a total of $172.10. Meaning that $172.10 would be my monthly payment. I went to bankrate.com and used their auto loan calculator and they came up with $192.48The bank came up with $205.00 (I think they added credit, life, and disability)So what the HECK am I missing......Please help!

What are the odds??  Probability or Statistics or Chance Theory??  Dont' know...?OK...  I apologize, but I don't even know how to categorize this... I think some sort of "probability" question... if I need to change my title to get more responses, feel free to coach me.Here's the real life thing that happened to me, and I want to know what the chances of this happening to someone are...
An event happens that has 480 participants, and 8 of those are "chosen" (equal odds of being chosen).
Then a year later another event happens and there are 620 participants, of which 6 are chosen (again equal odds on being chosen).  Of the 620 the second year, about 180 of them were at the event the first year (I don't think the "year later" is a factor, but it's what happened... but how many people were at both might be a factor in the odds- I don't really know).
What is the chance of someone that attends both events to be one of the 8 AND THEN one of the 6 a year later??????
That's what happened to me today and I'm just dying to know what the odds are of that happening

7th Grade Math homework?Ok. So I have this question on this worksheet and I just can't get it. It says, &quot;
What are the sums on of all of the first 500 counting numbers (1+2+3+4........498+499+500)?&quot; 
and I have a button on my calculator that can multiply all of those number but I can't add them and I tried to add 1-10 which is 55 and multiply it by 50 (10 times 50 = 500) but it was like 2750 or something which is way too low considering you have to add up all of the 100-400's and 500. Anyway, the next question is &quot;
How about just the odds (1+3+5+7.....495+497+499)?&quot;

How do you determine the probability of an event happening at least once in a given set of trials?
My husband has an illness and according to statistics, there is a 13% chance that our daughter will have that illness.  I am expecting another child.  I know that the chance that both will have it is 13% x 13% or 1.69% (correct me if I'm wrong) and that if we have a third child the chance that all will have it is 13% X 13% X 13% or .2197%.  What I would like to know is that if we have two children, what is the chance that ONE will have the illness.  I know you don't simply add the probabilities and get 26%.  (Otherwise if I flipped a coin twice, the chance that I would get heads once would be 100% which it is clearly not).
  So what is the formula I use?  And what is the probability of having one child with the condition if we have three children (or of two children out of three having it) and so on.
Thanks in advance!
